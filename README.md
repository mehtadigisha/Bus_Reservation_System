# Bus Reservation System

* This project presents a Bus Reservation System, designed to streamline the process of booking bus tickets for travelers. The system allows users to easily browse available buses, select seats, and make reservations, all from the comfort of their homes.
  
* Key features include the ability to book multiple seats at once, cancel bookings using a unique ID, and manage reservations based on the bus company, with pricing varying accordingly. The system is designed to be userfriendly, ensuring a seamless booking experience while maintaining data integrity and security.

* By automating and simplifying the ticket booking process, this system aims to enhance the convenience and efficiency of bus travel, catering to the needs of modern-day travelers who prefer online booking over traditional methods
